![Project Logo](https://github.com/AndiDemon/HumMovForecasting/blob/master/figures/spatial_temporal_tssa_.png)

## Introduction

This research presents the Temporal-Spatial Time Series Self-Attention method for human motion forecasting. The approach
is evaluated using the Human3.6M, 3DPW, and AMASS datasets based on standard evaluation protocols. Hope you find it useful!

## Data

2D human motion forecasting task:
1. Human3.6M dataset
2. 3DPW dataset

3D human motion forecasting task:
1. Human3.6M dataset
2. AMASS dataset

## Commands
To train the model, you can use the following command:
```python
python train_h36m
```
To evaluate the model, you can use the following command:
```python
python test_h36m
```

![Project Logo](https://github.com/AndiDemon/HumMovForecasting/blob/master/figures/spatial_temporal_tssa_.png)

## Introduction

This research presents the Temporal-Spatial Time Series Self-Attention method for human motion forecasting. The approach
is evaluated using the Human3.6M, 3DPW, and AMASS datasets based on standard evaluation protocols. Hope you find it useful!
This work was published in the 2023 IEEE IAICT, Bali, Indonesia. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10205596
